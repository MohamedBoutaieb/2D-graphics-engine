# 3D object simulation 

## 1.Description 

The simulation is implemented on two scripts :

part1.py simulates the representation of a 3d object projected on a 2d plane

part2.py also simulates the same representation but with surfaces colored, each side's color variates from #0000FF to #00005F according to the angle the Z-index does with the normal vector of the surface

## 2.how to use the simulation

clone the repository and launch part1.py or part2.py with a python ide or from terminal enter the following command line :
__py part1_or_part2.py__

then enter the filepath from which you will read the object.

use the mouse left click and move the mouse to rotate the object and observe it
